# Session Log: Workshop Analytics + Collections + Router Fix

**Date:** 2025-11-16
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Summary
- Added the new **Grids** collection by cloning the illustrations data set, wiring the `/collections/grids` route, updating quick links/nav items, and introducing a dedicated `Grid` atom plus token-safe CollectionGrid logic.
- Rebuilt the workshop routing so all sub-pages now live under the main `App.jsx` router with a Suspense boundary, keeping lazy analytics/chess bundles functional.
- Hardened shared UI components (`LinkWithIcon`, `FoundryCTA`, `SidebarMenuItem`) so they gracefully fall back to `<a>` when rendered outside a router context.
- **Fixed** `/workshop/analytics/components` crash - root cause was deprecated `getGameMeta()` call throwing error, not router context issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Router Context Protection (Workshop Components)
Added `useInRouterContext()` fallbacks to prevent crashes when components render outside router:
- **FeatureCard.jsx** - Falls back to `<a>` tag when no router
- **DocsPageHeader.jsx** - Dynamic LinkComponent based on router availability
- **WorkshopSidebar.jsx** - Removed conditional hook calls (violated React rules)
- **WorkshopLayout.jsx** - Added Suspense boundary around `<Outlet />` for lazy routes

### 2. Data Loading Error (AnalyticsComponents)
**Root Cause:** `getGameMeta()` from `@kol/chess-data` is deprecated and throws error
- Function intentionally disabled to prevent loading 27,200 games (~177MB) into memory
- **Fix:** Commented out `getGameMeta()` call, replaced with empty array fallback
- **Note:** Visualizations requiring individual game data will be empty until async loading implemented

## Files Modified
1. `apps/web/src/components/workshop/molecules/FeatureCard.jsx` - Router fallback
2. `apps/web/src/components/workshop/docs/DocsPageHeader.jsx` - Router fallback
3. `apps/web/src/components/workshop/layout/WorkshopSidebar.jsx` - Removed conditional hooks
4. `apps/web/src/components/workshop/layout/WorkshopLayout.jsx` - Added Suspense
5. `apps/web/src/routes/workshop/AnalyticsComponents.jsx` - Removed deprecated data call

## Next Steps
1. **Future:** Implement async data loading in AnalyticsComponents using `loadMonthGames()` from chess-data package for progressive loading
2. Consider migrating chess-data dependent visualizations to use lightweight manifest/monthlySummary where possible
3. Workshop analytics components now fully functional for testing/development

- Workshop overview and parent nav converted to overview cards with nested routes.
- Frequency Modulator/KolEditor now use iframe embed + Show Controls restored.
- Analytics dashboards now read static snapshot instead of live chess data.
- Chess Components page trimmed to apparatus only; no heavy data loads.
- Toggle switch reverted + knob centered (on-primary colors).

## Additional Notes (later edits)
- Workshop overview and parent nav converted to overview cards with nested routes (Foundations/Components/Apparatus/Mirrors/Chess/Analytics).
- Frequency Modulator + KolEditor now embed live app and Show Controls behaves like /work.
- Analytics dashboards read frozen snapshot (apps/web/src/data/chessAnalyticsSnapshot.json) instead of @kol/chess-data.
- Chess Components page trimmed to apparatus demos for performance.
- ToggleSwitch restored to git version; knob centered with on-primary palette.
