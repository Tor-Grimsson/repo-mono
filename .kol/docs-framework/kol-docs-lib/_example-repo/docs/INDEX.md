# Example repo — docs home

Worked reference tree showing the three-layer split.

- **[[documentation/INDEX|documentation/]]** — what this repo is about (numbered sections).
- **[[operations/INDEX|operations/]]** — repo machinery (release, CI, workbench) — a sibling, not a numbered section.
- `.kol/llm-context/` — agent state, outside this vault, at the repo root.

`.obsidian/` here is symlinked from `~/.dotfiles/obsidian/<shape>` — see the `kol-docs-lib` package's obsidian doc.
