# kol-media-admin — history & decisions

Knowledge base tracking the conversation that produced this project, the alternatives considered, and the reasoning behind core decisions. Reference for humans or future AI sessions that need the *why* rather than the *what*.

For decisions as enforced rules, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`. For current operational state, see `AGENT-CONTEXT.md`.

## origin

[One-paragraph description of what motivated this project. What was the problem that existed before this? What prompted building it?]

---

## alternatives surveyed and rejected

<!-- List the options considered before landing on the current approach. Structure:
### [Alternative name]
- [Why it was considered]
- **Rejected:** [specific reason(s)]
-->

### [Alternative 1]

- [Brief description]
- **Rejected:** [reason]

---

## core principles

[Principles that emerged through iteration. These may not have been stated up front but surfaced as the project took shape.]

- **[Principle 1]** — [description]
- ...

---

## architectural decisions

<!-- Narrative form of the decisions in ARCHITECTURE.md, with context. Structure:
### Why [decision]
[Paragraph explaining the reasoning and what it rules out.]
-->

### Why [major decision]

[Explanation.]

## API / interface evolution

[If the public surface changed through iteration, record how. Useful for understanding why current shapes look the way they do.]

---

## discussion outside the build

[Context that didn't become code but shaped thinking. Conversations about distribution, scope, non-goals, related tools.]

---

## references

[Links to external resources that informed decisions — docs, articles, tools considered.]

## what's *not* in this document

- Installation instructions → `../README.md`
- Load-bearing decisions stated as rules → `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Current state, roadmap, gotchas, contracts → `AGENT-CONTEXT.md`
- Session-by-session dev log → `session-log/`
- Speculative future work → `plan.md`

This file is purely the decision history. Update it when a core decision is revisited or reversed, not for routine changes.
